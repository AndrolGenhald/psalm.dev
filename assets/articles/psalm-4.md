I’m really happy to announce the release of Psalm 4. If you’re unfamiliar with Psalm, it’s a free & open-source static analysis tool that helps you identify problems in PHP.

It’s been almost two years since Psalm 3 was released, and a lot has happened! The PHP world has embraced static analysis in a big way – Psalm itself is over *15 times* more popular. There's also a fantastic community of contributers ticketing bugs, submitting PRs and generally helping to make Psalm a really useful, well-tested tool.

PHP has changed too, with a big release – PHP 8 – coming out in a month’s time. I’ve spent the last few months working on Psalm 4, so it can [fully support the great new PHP 8 features](/articles/php-8-support).

Psalm 4 also has [better unused variable detection](/articles/better-unused-variable-detection) _and_ [it's faster, by default](/articles/whats-the-difference).

Give it a whirl, and [let me know what you think](https://twitter.com/psalmphp)!
